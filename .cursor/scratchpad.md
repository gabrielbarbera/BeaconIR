## 🧭 UPDATED 6-PHASE STRATEGIC PLAN (2025-01-27)

### **NEW PRD ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS**

**Key Changes from New PRD:**
- New PRD is more comprehensive and platform-focused
- Emphasizes multi-client IR site generation system
- Adds Partner Portal layer for PR agencies
- Specifies Strapi CMS + Supabase Auth integration
- Requires automated deployment pipeline (Vercel/Railway)
- Defines 100+ client site scalability requirement

**Current Gap Analysis:**
- ✅ Marketing site exists (Next.js + Tailwind)
- ✅ Modular architecture foundation (IR/PR/Bundle modules)
- ⚠️ Type definitions exist but TODOs everywhere
- ❌ No database integration (Airtable/Strapi)
- ❌ No CMS deployment (Strapi on Railway)
- ❌ No auth implementation (Supabase)
- ❌ No IR site template generation
- ❌ No partner portal (dashboard)
- ❌ No automated deployment

**Strategic Decision:**
The new PRD aligns with our modular architecture but requires full implementation. We'll build the platform system, not just a marketing site.

### **Phase Status Overview**

| Phase | Status | Priority | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| Phase 1: Foundation (Brand + Marketing Site) | 🟢 Complete | CRITICAL | Weeks 1-3 |
| Phase 2: IR Platform Core (CMS + Auth + Templates) | 🟡 Next | CRITICAL | Weeks 4-8 |
| Phase 3: Partner Portal & Dashboard | 🔵 Planned | HIGH | Weeks 9-12 |
| Phase 4: PR Distribution Integration | 🔵 Planned | HIGH | Weeks 13-16 |
| Phase 5: Launch & Pilot Clients | 🔵 Planned | HIGH | Weeks 17-20 |
