# 💸 **Beacon IR – Pricing & Offer Structure (v1.0)**

## 🧭 Guiding principles

1. **Transparency > Negotiation**

   No “contact sales” walls. Public pricing with modular upgrades.
2. **Time-to-value** is the key metric.

   Every plan should launch an IR site or campaign  *fast* .
3. **Founder-first entry point** , but *scales* to public-company IR.
4. **Blend productized service + SaaS** — think Webflow + Presswire.
