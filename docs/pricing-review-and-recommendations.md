### Potential Issues

   - Growth lacks some key features
   - Starter is limited feature-wise

## üìä Recommendations

### 1. **Strategic Recommendations**

#### A. Add a "Premium" Tier
**Current gap:** Growth ($500) to Pro ($1,000) is a large jump.

**Suggestion:**
```
Starter: $250/mo
Growth: $500/mo
Premium: $750/mo (NEW)
Pro: $1,000-2,500/mo
```

**Premium Tier Could Include:**
- Everything in Growth
- AI Content Assistant
- Custom Integrations
- Enhanced support

#### B. Adjust Growth Tier Pricing
**Option 1:** Increase Growth to $750/mo
- More features included
- Better profit margins
- Closer to PRD target range

**Option 2:** Keep Growth at $500 but add more features
- Better value proposition
- Clearer differentiation

#### C. Add "Agency/Partner" Tier
**Current:** Only mentioned in pricing doc as "Custom"

**Suggestion:**
Add as fourth tier card:
```
Agency/Partner: Custom
- White-label infrastructure
- Rev-share model
- For IR firms and VCs
```

## üìà Revenue Model Recommendations

### 1. **Annual vs Monthly Strategy**

**Current:** 15% discount for annual

**Recommendation:** Increase to 20% discount
- More appealing to annual buyers
- Better cash flow upfront
- Industry standard (16-25%)

### 2. **Setup Fees**

**Current Structure:**
- Starter: $500
- Growth: $1,000  
- Pro: $2,500 (variable)

**Analysis:**
- Starter setup fee is high relative to monthly ($500 setup vs $250/mo = 2 months)
- Could create friction for early adopters

**Recommendation:**
- Consider waiving/reducing setup for first 10-20 customers
- Or: Two-tier setup fees (basic $250, premium $750+)

### 3. **Add-On Strategy**

**Current:** All add-ons available to all tiers

**Recommendation:** Tier-specific add-ons
- Starter: Limited add-ons (focus on essentials)
- Growth: Full add-on catalog
- Pro: Most add-ons included or discounted

**Why:** Creates incentive to upgrade, reduces complexity for beginners

## üéØ Go-to-Market Recommendations

### 1. **Landing Page Flow**

**Recommended Flow:**
1. Homepage ‚Üí Solutions (learn features)
2. Solutions ‚Üí Pricing (see cost)
3. Pricing ‚Üí Demo/Contact (convert)

**Current:** Pricing link in navbar ‚úÖ

### 2. **Pricing Page Optimizations**

**Add Before/After Comparison:**
```
Traditional IR Service: $5,000/mo + heavy setup
Beacon IR Growth: $500/mo + quick setup
Save: $4,500+/month
```

**Add Social Proof:**
```

### 3. **Call-to-Action Strategy**

**Current:** Generic "Get Started" buttons

**Recommendation:** Action-specific CTAs
- Starter: "Start Your IR Site"
- Growth: "Scale Your Communications"  
- Pro: "Talk to IR Experts"

## üîß Technical Recommendations

### 1. **Billing Integration**

**Current:** Calendly links (manual conversion)

**Recommendation:** Add payment processing
- Stripe for subscription billing
- Paddle for international (VAT handling)
- Automated invoicing from Agiled

**Implementation Plan:**
```typescript
// billing-logic.ts (Next Step)
export const tiers = {
  starter: {
    monthly: 250,
    annual: 250 * 12 * 0.85, // 15% discount
    setup: 500
  },
  growth: {
    monthly: 500,
    annual: 500 * 12 * 0.85,
    setup: 1000
  },
  pro: {
    monthly: 1000,
    annual: 1000 * 12 * 0.85,
    setup: 2500
  }
}
```

### 2. **Feature Flags**

**For future self-service:**
```typescript
// Check user tier for feature access
export function hasFeature(tier: 'starter' | 'growth' | 'pro', feature: string) {
  const featureMatrix = {
    'email-distribution': ['growth', 'pro'],
    'analytics': ['growth', 'pro'],
    'ai-assistant': ['pro'],
    'custom-integrations': ['pro'],
